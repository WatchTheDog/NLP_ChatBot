# NLP_ChatBot
First assignment for Natural Language Processing. Simple chat bot that handles as a shopping assistant

# Your bot should include (at least) the following features:
- a detection of keywords and/or key phrases, with appropriate responses
- an „intelligent“ continuation of the dialogue in case no keyword or key phrase was detected
- a random generation & selection of answers
- a „you – I reversal“ in the dialogue (e.g. Input: I am happy. Answer: Why are you happy?)
- at least one „intelligent component“, such as remembering and referring to what has been said before, i.e. prior to the directly preceding input.
